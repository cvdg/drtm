The host raspberrypi should be on your local netwerk and an IP
should have been issued by your DHCP server.

Find the IP number with nmap or look at the status page of your
DHPC server i.e. your modem.

You should be able to login with ssh:

ssh -A pi@192.168.178.43

Username: pi
Default password: raspberry

You should remove this account as soon as you are done setting up
the pi.
